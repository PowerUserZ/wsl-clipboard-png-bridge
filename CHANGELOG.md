## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-20

Initial public release.

### Added
- `wsl-clipboard-png-bridge` main daemon: polls the WSLg Wayland clipboard at
  300 ms intervals, converts `image/bmp` to `image/png` with ImageMagick,
  publishes the PNG to both Wayland (`wl-copy`) and X11 (`xclip`) clipboards.
- `install.sh` — idempotent installer with sentinel-marked `~/.bashrc` block
  and `flock`-based single-instance auto-start.
- `uninstall.sh` — reverse of install; leaves apt packages in place.
- `.github/workflows/shellcheck.yml` — lint-only CI on push / pull request.
- Hardening: `set -euo pipefail`, signal trap for temp-file cleanup,
  `timeout 5` around the ImageMagick conversion, regex validation of
  `CLIPBOARD_WATCH_INTERVAL` and `CLIPBOARD_CONVERT_TIMEOUT`, startup
  dependency check.
